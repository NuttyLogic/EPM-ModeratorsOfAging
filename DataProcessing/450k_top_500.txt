3. DNA methylation-based classification of human central nervous system tumors [reference set]
(Submitter supplied) Background: Modern neuropathology is challenged by an increasing number of clinically-relevant CNS tumor subgroups that require assessment of a multitude of molecular markers for classification, as well a highly trained medical staff. Failure to meet this challenge leads to tumor misclassification, which can have severe consequences for affected patients.  Methods: We compiled a cohort of genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of 2,682 tumors from 82 histologically and/or molecularly distinct CNS tumor classes across all ages and histologies that served as reference for a Random Forest-based diagnostic classifier. more...

20. Landscape of DNA methylation on the X chromosome reflects CpG density, functional chromatin state and X-chromosome inactivation.
(Submitter supplied) X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) achieves dosage compensation between males and females through the silencing of the majority of genes on one X chromosome, with approximately 15% of genes reported to show inactive X (Xi) expression.  We examined the interplay between ChromHMM states, CpG density, expression and DNAm from over 1800 female samples with the Illumina 450K array.  The interaction between CpG density and histone marks differed between the active X (Xa) and the Xi, with X-linked promoters reflecting transcriptional status, while the Xi showed lower DNAm than the Xa at all non-promoter regions. more...

125. The PedBE clock accurately estimates DNA methylation age in pediatric buccal cells [dataset 15, MAVAN mothers cohort]
(Submitter supplied) The development of current biological markers of aging has primarily focused on adult samples. The epigenetic clock is one promising tool for measuring biological age that shows impressive accuracy across most tissues and age ranges. In adults, deviations from the DNA methylation (DNAm) age prediction are correlated with several age-related phenotypes, such as mortality and frailty. In children, however, fewer such associations have been made, possibly because DNAm changes are more dynamic in pediatric populations as compared to adults. more...

129. Early- and late-onset preeclampsia and the tissue-specific epigenome of the placenta and newborn
(Submitter supplied) Introduction. Preeclampsia (PE) carries increased risks of cardiovascular- and metabolic diseases in mothers and offspring during the life course. While the severe early-onset PE (EOPE) phenotype originates from impaired placentation in early pregnancy, late-onset PE (LOPE) is in particular associated with pre-existing maternal cardiovascular- and metabolic risk factors. We hypothesize that PE is associated with altered epigenetic programming of placental and fetal tissues and that these epigenetic changes might elucidate the increased cardiovascular- and metabolic disease susceptibility in PE offspring. more...

(Submitter supplied) We surveyed the genotypes and DNA methylomes of 237 neonates and found 1423 punctate regions of the methylome that were highly variable across individuals, termed variably methylated regions (VMRs), against a backdrop of homogeneity. Although methQTLs were readily detected in neonatal methylomes, genotype alone did not explain the majority of the VMRs. We found that the best explanation for 75% of VMRs was the interaction of genotype with different in utero environments, including maternal smoking, maternal depression, maternal BMI, infant birth weight, gestational age and birth order.

139. CHARGE and Kabuki syndromes: Gene-specific DNA methylation signatures
(Submitter supplied) Epigenetic dysregulation has emerged as mechanism in the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders. Two such disorders, CHARGE and Kabuki syndromes, result from loss of function mutations in chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 (CHD7LOF) and lysine (K) methyltransferase 2D (KMT2DLOF), respectively. We expected that epigenetically driven developmental pathways regulated by CHD7 and KMT2D would overlap and that DNA methylation (DNAm) alterations downstream of the mutations in these genes would identify common target genes, elucidating a mechanistic link between these conditions, as well as specific target genes for each. more...

The duality of Krebs versus kinase molecular and epigenomic profiles in GIST provides compelling evidence linking mitochondrial process to nuclear structure and function and underscores an essential role for succinate metabolism in the maintenance of epigenomic programming and tumor suppression.

(Submitter supplied) The development of current biological markers of aging has primarily  focused on adult samples. The epigenetic clock is one promising tool  for measuring biological age that shows impressive accuracy across  most tissues and age ranges. In adults, deviations from the DNA  methylation (DNAm) age prediction are correlated with several agerelated phenotypes, such as mortality and frailty. In children,  however, fewer such associations have been made, possibly because  DNAm changes are more dynamic in pediatric populations as  compared to adults. more...

204. DNA Methylation Markers Predict Recurrence-free Interval in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.
(Submitter supplied) We lack tools to risk-stratify triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Our goal was to develop molecular tools to predict disease recurrence. Methylation array analysis was performed on 110 samples treated by locoregional therapy obtained from Institutional cohorts. Discovered marker sets were then tested by Kaplan Meier analyses in a prospectively collected TNBC cohort of 49 samples from the no chemotherapy arms of IBCSG trials VIII and IX, and by logistic regression in a chemotherapy-treated cohort of 121 TNBCs from combined IBCSG trials and Institutional repositories. more...

(Submitter supplied) The development of current biological markers of aging has primarily focused on adult samples. The epigenetic clock is one promising tool for measuring biological age that shows impressive accuracy across most tissues and age ranges. In adults, deviations from the DNA methylation (DNAm) age prediction are correlated with several agerelated phenotypes, such as mortality and frailty. In children, however, fewer such associations have been made, possibly because DNAm changes are more dynamic in pediatric populations as  compared to adults. more...

(Submitter supplied) Melanoma resistance to MAPK- or T cell checkpoint-targeted therapies represents a major clinical challenge, and treatment failures of MAPK-targeted therapies due to acquired resistance often require salvage immunotherapies. We show that genomic analysis of acquired resistance to MAPK inhibitors revealed key driver genes but failedto adequately account for clinical resistance. From a large-scale comparative analysis of temporal transcriptomes from patient-matched tumor biopsies, we discovered highly recurrent differential expression and signature outputs of c-MET, LEF1 and YAP1 as drivers of acquired MAPK inhibitor resistance. more...

243. Ageing-associated changes in DNA methylation in humans
(Submitter supplied) Background: DNA methylation, a component of the epigenome that regulates both single genes and large sections of chromatin, is altered with ageing and is speculated to be one of the molecular mechanisms contributing to the ageing process. In our analysis, we sought to identify ageing-associated methylation changes at single- CpG-site resolution in blood leukocytes and to ensure that the observed changes were not due to differences in the proportions of leukocytes. more...

245. Integrative analyses of rhabdoid tumors across all anatomical sites reveal subgroups with possible immune modulation through epigenetic dysregulation
(Submitter supplied) Extra-cranial malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRTs) and cranial atypical teratoid RTs (ATRTs) are pediatric cancers driven by SMARCB1 loss. To understand biological relationships between MRTs and ATRTs, we performed integrative data analyses of 140 MRTs and 161 ATRTs, and detected features conserved between MRTs and the MYC subgroup of ATRTs, including global DNA hypomethylation and over-expression of HOX and mesenchymal development genes, thereby distinguishing them from other ATRT subgroups that exhibit neural-like features. more...

246. Trajectories of DNA hydroxymethylation across human brain development
(Submitter supplied) Epigenetic processes play a key role in orchestrating transcriptional regulation during the development of the human central nervous system. We previously described dynamic changes in DNA methylation occurring during human fetal brain development, but other epigenetic processes operating during this period have not been extensively explored. Of particular interest is DNA hydroxymethylation (5hmC), a modification that is enriched in the human brain and hypothesized to play an important role in neuronal function, learning and memory. more...

248. Methylation data from glioblastoma tumor samples
(Submitter supplied) Glioblastoma (GBM) is an incurable brain tumor carrying a dismal prognosis, which displays considerable heterogeneity. We have recently identified recurrent H3F3A mutations affecting two critical positions of histone H3.3 (K27, G34) in one-third of pediatric GBM. Here we show that each of these H3F3A mutations defines an epigenetic subgroup of GBM with a distinct global methylation pattern, and are mutually exclusive with IDH1 mutations (characterizing a CpG-Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP) subgroup). more...

We herein demonstrated that these LTRs were transiently overexpressed during the generation of iPSCs and contributed to reprogramming. When the generation of iPSCs was completed, LTRs were re-suppressed to levels similar to those in human ES cells. more...

Although many genetic causes have been identified (>200 ASD-risk genes), no single gene mutation accounts for >1% of all ASD cases. A role for epigenetic mechanisms in ASD etiology is supported by the fact that many ASD-risk genes function as epigenetic regulators and evidence that epigenetic dysregulation can interrupt normal brain development. more...

266. Genome-wide variation of cytosine modifications between European and African populations and the implications for complex traits
(Submitter supplied) Elucidating cytosine modification difference between human populations can enhance our understanding of ethnic specificity in complex traits such as disease predisposition and drug response. In this study, cytosine modification levels in 133 HapMap lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from individuals of European or African ancestry were profiled using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Approximately 13% of the analyzed CpG sites showed differential modification between the two populations at false discovery rate (FDR) of 1%. CpG sites with greater modification levels in European descents were enriched in the proximal regulatory regions, while those greater in African descents were biased toward gene bodies. More than half of the detected population-specific cytosine modifications could be explained by genetic variation. A substantial proportion of local modification quantitative trait loci (mQTL) exhibited population-specific effects, suggesting that genetic epistasis and/or genotype × environment interaction could be common. Distinct inter-individual correlations were observed between gene expression and cytosine modifications in both proximal promoters and gene bodies, demonstrating a regulatory role of inter-individual variation in cytosine modification. Furthermore, a number of SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) previously identified for complex traits with known racial disparities could be annotated as mQTLs for population-specific CpGs. Our findings revealed abundant population-specific cytosine modifications and the underlying genetic basis, as well as the relatively independent contribution of genetic and epigenetic variations to population differences in gene expression.

(Submitter supplied) The development of current biological markers of aging has primarily focused on adult samples. The epigenetic clock is one promising tool for measuring biological age that shows impressive accuracy across most tissues and age ranges. In adults, deviations from the DNA methylation (DNAm) age prediction are correlated with several agerelated phenotypes, such as mortality and frailty. In children, however, fewer such associations have been made, possibly because DNAm changes are more dynamic in pediatric populations as  compared to adults. more...

369. Functional and Topographic Effects on DNA Methylation Across IDH1/2 Mutant Cancers
(Submitter supplied) Background: IDH1/2 mutations are present in cancer arising from various tissues; however, common and disease specific effects on DNA methylation across IDH mutant cancers remain unknown. Results: We analyzed DNA methylation data from IDH1/2 mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML), oligodendroglioma, astrocytoma, breast carcinoma, sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC) and cholangiocarcinoma. We show that only a small fraction of differentially methylated probes is disease specific and that hypermethylation affects predominantly gene bodies and enhancers while gene promoters in IDH1/2 mutant cancers remain profoundly unmethylated. more...

(Submitter supplied) The development of current biological markers of aging has primarily focused on adult samples. The epigenetic clock is one promising tool for measuring biological age that shows impressive accuracy across most tissues and age ranges. In adults, deviations from the DNA methylation (DNAm) age prediction are correlated with several agerelated phenotypes, such as mortality and frailty. In children, however, fewer such associations have been made, possibly because DNAm changes are more dynamic in pediatric populations as  compared to adults. more...

401. Deciphering the genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic landscapes of pre-invasive lung cancer lesions to determine prognosis III
(Submitter supplied) Rationale: Lung carcinoma-in-situ (CIS) lesions are the pre-malignant precursor to lung squamous cell carcinoma. However, only half progress to invasive cancer in three years, while a third spontaneously regress. Whether modern molecular profiling techniques can identify those preinvasive lesions that will subsequently progress and distinguish them from those that will regress is unknown. We performed gene expression microarrays on CIS lesions, with a view to deriving a molecular signature predictive of future progression to invasive cancer.

(Submitter supplied) Down syndrome is characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical signs, which include cognitive and endocrine disorders and haematological abnormalities. Although it is well established that the causative defect of Down syndrome is the trisomy of chromosome 21, the molecular bases of Down syndrome phenotype are still largely unknown. We used the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip to investigate DNA methylation patterns in whole blood from 29 subjects affected by Down syndrome (DS), using their healthy relatives as controls (mothers  and unaffected siblings). more...

404. Analysis of sex differences in DNA methylation in human pancreatic islets
(Submitter supplied) Epigenetic factors regulate tissue-specific expression and X-chromosome inactivation. Previous studies have identified epigenetic differences between sexes in some human tissues. However, it is unclear whether epigenetic modifications contribute to sex-specific differences in insulin secretion and metabolism. In this study, we investigated the impact of sex on the genome-wide DNA methylation pattern in human pancreatic islets from 53 males and 34 females, and related the methylome to changes in expression and insulin secretion.

443. The epigenetic signature of systemic insulin resistance in obese women [SC]
(Submitter supplied) Impaired ability of insulin to stimulate cellular glucose uptake and regulate metabolism, that is insulin resistance (IR), links adiposity to metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease (Langenberg, 2012). Both genetic and epigenetic factors are implicated in development of systemic IR (Vaag, 2001). IR is characterized by elevated levels of fasting insulin in the general circulation. more...

444. Genome-wide methylation profiles in primary intracranial germ cell tumors indicate primordial germ cell origin of germinoma [Illumina]
(Submitter supplied) The pathogenesis of intracranial germ cell tumors (iGCTs) is not yet fully uncovered despite exhaustive genomic analyses. By means of a genome-wide methylation analysis, we show that pure germinoma is characterized by global DNA low methylation, a unique epigenetic feature distinct from all other subtypes of iGCTs. The patterns of methylation strongly resemble that of primordial germ cells (PGC) at the migration phase, indicating the cells of origin. more...

466. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of colorectal adenomas with and without recurrence reveals an association between CpG methylation and histological subtypes.
(Submitter supplied) Aberrant methylation of DNA is supposed to be a major and early driver of colonic adenoma development and may also lead to colorectal cancer (CRC) formation. While gene methylation assays are used already for CRC screening, differential epigenetic alterations of recurring and non-recurring colorectal adenomas have yet not been systematically investigated. Here, we collected a sample set (n=72) of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary colorectal adenomas without recurrence (n=30), primary adenomas with recurrence at the same location (n=19), so-called “matched pair samples” (n=10; comprising the primary adenoma and the recurrent adenoma) and normal mucosa specimens (n=3). more...

490. BECon: A tool for interpreting DNA methylation findings from blood in the context of brain
(Submitter supplied) Tissue differences are one of the largest contributors to variability in the human DNA methylome. Despite the tissue specific nature of DNA methylation, the inaccessibility of human brain samples necessitates the frequent use of surrogate tissues such as blood, in studies of associations between DNA methylation and brain function and health. Results from studies of surrogate tissues in humans are difficult to interpret in this context, as the connection between blood-brain DNA methylation is tenuous and not well documented. more...

491. DNA methylation profile of triple negative breast cancer specific genes (validation)
(Submitter supplied) Purpose Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype with no targeted treatment available. Our previous study identified 38 TNBC-specific genes with altered expression in tumour samples compared to normal samples. This study aimed to identify whether DNA methylation contributed to these gene expression changes in the same breast cancer cohort. Additionally, we aimed to identify a whole genome methylation profile that contributes to the progression from primary breast tumour to lymph node metastasis. more...

(Submitter supplied) We report that the DNA methylation profile of a child’s neonatal whole blood can be significantly influenced by his or her mother’s neonatal blood lead levels (BLL). We recruited 35 mother-infant pairs in Detroit and measured the whole blood lead (Pb) levels and DNA methylation levels at over 450,000 loci from current blood and neonatal blood from both the mother and the child. We found that mothers with high neonatal BLL correlate with altered DNA methylation at 564 loci in their children’s neonatal blood. more...
