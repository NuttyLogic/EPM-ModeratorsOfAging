29. Rare genetic variation at transcription factor binding site modulates local DNA methylation profiles
(Submitter supplied) Recently, it has been proposed that local DNA methylation profiles might be dictated by cis-regulatory DNA sequences that mainly operate via DNA-binding factors. Combining blood genome-wide DNA methylation profiles (Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChiP), whole genome sequencing-derived single nucleotide variants (SNVs) along with predicted transcription factor binding site (TFBS), we were able to observe that rare regulatory variants, i.e, SNVs that disrupt TFBSs, are associated with DNA methylation at both local and, to a lesser extent, broader locations. more...

41. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling identifies two novel genes in cervical neoplasia
(Submitter supplied) Using a genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of 186 cervical samples from women with different CIN grades and well-characterized HPV genotyping, we identified novel methylation markers of epigenetic changes that discriminate accurately between clinically significant and transient cervical disease. In particular, a 2-gene DNA methylation classifier (ATP10A and HAS1) showed a promising ability to discriminate among pre-invasive cervical lesion grades. more...

42. DNA methylation covariation in human whole blood and sperm
(Submitter supplied) Epidemiological studies in humans suggest that acquired paternal traits, such as obesity, are associated with a higher risk of fathering small for gestational age offspring. Studies in non-human mammals suggest that such associations could be mediated by DNA methylation changes in spermatozoa that influence offspring development in utero. Human obesity is associated with differential DNA methylation in peripheral blood. more...

49. The PedBE clock accurately estimates DNA methylation age in pediatric buccal cells [dataset 8, BIBO]
(Submitter supplied) The development of current biological markers of aging has primarily focused on adult samples. The epigenetic clock is one promising tool for measuring biological age that shows impressive accuracy across most tissues and age ranges. In adults, deviations from the DNA methylation (DNAm) age prediction are correlated with several agerelated phenotypes, such as mortality and frailty. In children, however, fewer such associations have been made, possibly because DNAm changes are more dynamic in pediatric populations as compared to adults. more...

(Submitter supplied) Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) liver disease is characterized by marked heterogeneity in presentation and progression, despite a common underlying gene mutation, strongly suggesting the involvement of other genetic and/or epigenetic modifiers. Variation in clinical phenotype has added to the challenge of detection, diagnosis, and testing of new therapies in patients with AATD. We examined the contribution of DNA methylation (5-methylcytosine [5mC]) to AATD liver disease heterogeneity because 5mC responds to environmental and genetic cues and its deregulation is a major driver of liver disease. more...

(Submitter supplied) Background: IDH1/2 mutations are present in cancer arising from various tissues; however, common and disease specific effects on DNA methylation across IDH mutant cancers remain unknown. Results: We analyzed DNA methylation data from IDH1/2 mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML), oligodendroglioma, astrocytoma, breast carcinoma, sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC) and cholangiocarcinoma. We show that only a small fraction of differentially methylated probes is disease specific and that hypermethylation affects predominantly gene bodies and enhancers while gene promoters in IDH1/2 mutant cancers remain profoundly unmethylated. more...

(Submitter supplied) Coffin-Siris and Nicolaides-Baraitser syndromes (CSS and NCBRS) are Mendelian disorders caused by mutations in subunits of the BAF chromatin remodeling complex. We report overlapping peripheral blood DNA methylation epi-signatures in individuals with various subtypes of CSS (ARID1B, SMARCB1, and SMARCA4) and NCBRS (SMARCA2). We demonstrate that the degree of similarity in the epi-signatures of some CSS subtypes and NCBRS can be greater than that within CSS, indicating a link in the functional basis of the two syndromes. more...

179. DNA methylation analysis of astroblastomas
(Submitter supplied) Astroblastomas represent rare cerebral tumors of the central nervous system (CNS).  The status of astroblastoma as a distinct molecular entity is controversial, largely because the molecular features of astroblastomas have not been comprehensively evaluated.  Herein, we used methylation profiling to compare the signatures of astroblastoma to a reference cohort of brain tumor entities.  We found that astroblastomas are molecularly heterogenous and share molecular features with known brain tumor entities including plexomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, high-grade neuroepithelial tumor with MN1 abnormalities, as supratentorial ependymomas with RELA fusions.

(Submitter supplied) CpG methylation by the de novo DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) 3A and 3B is essential for mammalian development and differentiation and is frequently dysregulated in cancer1. These two DNMTs preferentially bind to nucleosomes yet cannot methylate the DNA wrapped around the nucleosome core2, and favor the methylation of linker DNA at positioned nucleosomes3,4. Here we present the cryo-EM structure of a ternary complex of catalytically competent DNMT3A2, the catalytically inactive accessory subunit DNMT3B3, and a nucleosome core particle flanked by linker DNA. more...

201. Human Naive Pluripotency Attained by Transient Inhibition of mTOR
(Submitter supplied) Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) are in naive pluripotency that represents the ground state of development, from which all cells in the mouse embryo are derived. In contrast, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are in a primed state of pluripotency with many different properties. Despite intense efforts to generate naive human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), it has not been possible to derive naive hPSCs without relying on transgene overexpression or chemicals. more...

202. Genome-wide 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) emerges at early stage of in vitro hepatocyte differentiation [Methylation]
(Submitter supplied) How cells reach different fates despite using the same DNA template, is a basic question linked to differential patterns of gene expression. Since 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) emerged as an intermediate metabolite in active DNA demethylation, there have been increasing efforts to elucidate its function as a stable modification of the genome. Recently we described TET1-mediated enrichment of 5hmC on the promoter region of the master regulator of hepatocyte identity, HNF4A, which precedes differentiation of liver adult progenitor cells in vitro. more...

217. Transition to naïve human pluripotency mirrors pan-cancer DNA hypermethylation (data set 2)
(Submitter supplied) Aberrant DNA hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands in the context of a hypomethylated genome is a hallmark of cancer. Thus far there is no human experimental model available to mechanistically investigate this phenomenon. Here we show that upon reprogramming of human embryonic stem cells to the naïve state, the acquisition of a globally hypomethylated genome is accompanied by hypermethylation of a subset of bivalent promoter CpG islands, resulting in a DNA methylome comparable to the human inner cell mass. more...

218. DNA methylation changes induced by hypomethylating agent, Azacitidine (AZA); IDH1 inhibitor, BAY1436032 (BAY) and sequential and simultaneous combination of BAY and AZA in  in vitro treated human (CD45+) cells isolated from the  bone marrow of IDH1mut
(Submitter supplied) Mutations in the enzymes IDH1 and IDH2 have been identified in a wide variety of tumors like glioma, chondrosarcoma, thyroid cancer, lymphoma, melanoma, and in acute myeloid leukemia. Mutated IDH1/2 produces the metabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), which interferes with epigenetic regulation of gene expression, and thus may promote tumorigenesis.  Data for IDH1 inhibitors show that 30-40% of AML patients respond to monotherapy with a median duration of response of 8 months, suggesting that IDH1 inhibitors should be combined with other agents to improve efficacy. more...

219. A new hypomethylating agent, OR-2100, resists degradation by cytidine deaminase, leading to favorable oral absorbability and anti-leukemia effects
(Submitter supplied) DNA methyltransferase inhibitors have improved the prognosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). However, these agents must be administered intravenously or subcutaneously because they are degraded easily by cytidine deaminase (CDA). OR2100 (OR21), an oligonucleotide comprising decitabine nucleoside 5'-O-trisilylate, resists degradation by CDA. Direct duodenal administration led to high plasma concentrations of OR21 in a cynomolgus monkey model. more...

237. Placenta-specific DMRs maintain methylation across gestation.
(Submitter supplied) One possible mechanism leading to the apparent polymorphic placenta-specific DMRs would be the failure to maintain allelic methylation during gestation. For a temporal comparison, we performed methylation profiling on first trimester chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and compared it with corresponding samples at term. This revealed that DNA methylation level at placenta-specific DMRs is highly stable between the two points. more...

247. Quality control measures for placental sample purity in DNA methylation array analyses
(Submitter supplied) The purity of tissue samples can affect the accuracy and utility of DNA methylation array analyses. This is particularly important for the placenta which is hypomethylated. Placental villous tissue from early pregnancy terminations can be difficult to separate from the non-villous tissue, resulting in potentially inaccurate results. We used several methods to identify mixed placental samples using DNA methylation array datasets from our laboratory and those contained in the NCBI GEO database, highlighting the importance of determining sample purity during quality control processes.

279. Hit-and-run epigenetic editing prevents senescence entry in primary breast cells from healthy donors [EPIC methylation]
(Submitter supplied) Aberrant promoter DNA hypermethylation is a hallmark of cancer; however, whether this is sufficient to drive cellular transformation in the absence of genetic mutations is not clear. To investigate this question, we use a CRISPR/dCas9 based epigenetic editing tool, where an inactive form of Cas9 is fused to DNMT3A and its regulator DNMT3L. Using this system, we show simultaneous de novo DNA methylation of genes commonly methylated in cancer, CDKN2A, RASSF1, HIC1 and PTEN in primary myoepithelial cells isolated from healthy human breast tissue. more...

However, the ability of human PSCs to generate mature cell types is the only imperative property for translational utility. Here, we reveal that the naïve state enhances self-renewal capacity while restricting lineage differentiation in vitro to neural default fate. Gene expression analyses indicate expression of multiple lineage associated transcripts in naïve hPSCs and thus failed to predict biased functional differentiation. more...

312. Comparison of Methylation Capture Sequencing and Infinium EPIC Methylation Array in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells [EPIC array]
(Submitter supplied) Background: Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have been widely applied to identify methylation CpG sites associated with human disease. To date, the Infinium Methylation EPIC array (EPIC) is commonly used for high-throughput DNA methylation profiling. However, the EPIC array covers only 30% of the human methylome. Methylation Capture bisulfite sequencing (MC-seq) captures target regions of methylome and has advantages of extensive coverage in the methylome at an affordable price. more...

To investigate this question, we use a CRISPR/dCas9 based epigenetic editing tool, where an inactive form of Cas9 is fused to DNMT3A and its regulator DNMT3L. Using this system, we show simultaneous de novo DNA methylation of genes commonly methylated in cancer, CDKN2A, RASSF1, HIC1 and PTEN in primary myoepithelial cells isolated from healthy human breast tissue. more...
