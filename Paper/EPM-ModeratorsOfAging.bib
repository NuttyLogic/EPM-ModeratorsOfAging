              such as calorie restriction and growth hormone receptor
              knock-outs. Using DNA methylation data from previous publications
              with data collected in house for a total 1189 samples spanning
              193,651 CpG sites, we developed 4 novel epigenetic clocks by
              choosing different regression models (elastic net- versus ridge
              regression) and by considering different sets of CpGs (all CpGs
              vs highly conserved CpGs). We demonstrate that accurate age
              estimators can be built on the basis of highly conserved CpGs.
              However, the most accurate clock results from applying elastic
              net regression to all CpGs. While the anti-aging effect of
              calorie restriction could be detected with all types of
              epigenetic clocks, only ridge regression based clocks replicated
              the finding of slow epigenetic aging effects in dwarf mice.

              endocrine-disrupting compounds, polybrominated biphenyl (PBB) and
              polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB). A growing body of evidence
              suggests that exposure to certain endocrine-disrupting compounds
              may affect thyroid function, especially in people exposed as
              children, but there are conflicting observations. In this study,
              we extend previous work by examining age of exposure's effect on
              the relationship between PBB exposure and thyroid function in a
              large group of individuals exposed to PBB. METHODS: Linear
              regression models were used to test the association between serum
              measures of thyroid function (total thyroxine (T4), total
              triiodothyronine (T3), free T4, free T3, thyroid stimulating
              hormone (TSH), and free T3: free T4 ratio) and serum PBB and PCB
              levels in a cross-sectional analysis of 715 participants in the
              Michigan PBB Registry. RESULTS: Higher PBB levels were associated
              with many thyroid hormones measures, including higher free T3 (p
              = 0.002), lower free T4 (p = 0.01), and higher free T3: free T4
              ratio (p = 0.0001). Higher PCB levels were associated with higher
              free T4 (p = 0.0002), and higher free T3: free T4 ratio (p =
              0.002). Importantly, the association between PBB and thyroid
              hormones was dependent on age at exposure. Among people exposed

              Glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a marker for average blood
              glucose levels over the previous 12 weeks, is used as a measure
              of glycemic control and also as a diagnostic criterion for
              diabetes (HbA1c levels $\geq$ 6.5\%). Epigenetic mechanisms, such
              as DNA methylation, may be associated with aging processes and
              with modulation of the risk of various pathologies, such as DM.
              Specifically, DNA methylation could be one of the mechanisms
              mediating the relation between DM and environmental exposures.
              Our goal was to identify new CpG methylation sites associated
              with DM. We performed a genome-wide methylation study in
              whole-blood DNA from an IS patient cohorts. Illumina

              with DM (P = 1.17 $\times$ 10(-12)); this CpG was replicated in

              TXNIP was inversely and intensely associated with HbA1c levels (P
              = 7.3 $\times$ 10(-16)), specifically related to diabetic

              populations depends on the ability to estimate demographic trends
              and population viability and therefore requires accurate
              assessment of age structure. However, reliably aging wildlife is
              challenging as many methods are highly invasive, inaccurate, or
              both. Epigenetic aging models, which estimate individual age with
              high accuracy based on genomic methylation patterns, are
              promising developments in this regard. Importantly, epigenetic
              aging models developed for one species can potentially predict
              age with high accuracy in sister taxa. Using blood and biopsy
              samples from known age plains zebras ( Equus quagga ), we
              developed epigenetic clocks (ECs) to predict chronological age,
              and epigenetic pacemaker (EPM) models to predict biological age.
              We tested the ability of our blood-based EC to predict ages of
              Grevy's zebras, Somali asses and domestic horses, from blood
              samples. Because our samples came from a population with a

              sequencing effort to measure the association between levels of
              inbreeding (F and ROH) and the age acceleration as measured by
              DNA methylation. The resulting models describe the trajectory of
              epigenetic aging in plains zebras and accurately predict the ages

              for environmental conditions during prenatal development.
              Identical twin pairs discordant for birth weight provide an
              extraordinary model for investigating the association between
              birth weight and adult life health while controlling for not only
              genetics but also postnatal rearing environment. We performed an
              epigenome-wide profiling on blood samples from 150 pairs of adult
              monozygotic twins discordant for birth weight to look for
              molecular evidence of epigenetic signatures in association with
              birth weight discordance. RESULTS: Our association analysis
              revealed no CpG site with genome-wide statistical significance
              (FDR < 0.05) for either qualitative (larger or smaller) or
              quantitative discordance in birth weight. Even with selected
              samples of extremely birth weight discordant twin pairs, no
              significant site was found except for 3 CpGs that displayed

              (HM450) BeadChip has provided a user-friendly platform to profile
              DNA methylation in human samples. However, HM450 lacked coverage
              of distal regulatory elements. Illumina have now released the
              MethylationEPIC (EPIC) BeadChip, with new content specifically
              designed to target these regions. We have used HM450 and
              whole-genome bisulphite sequencing (WGBS) to perform a critical
              evaluation of the new EPIC array platform. RESULTS: EPIC covers
              over 850,000 CpG sites, including >90 \% of the CpGs from the
              HM450 and an additional 413,743 CpGs. Even though the additional
              probes improve the coverage of regulatory elements, including 58
              \% of FANTOM5 enhancers, only 7 \% distal and 27 \% proximal
              ENCODE regulatory elements are represented. Detailed comparisons
              of regulatory elements from EPIC and WGBS show that a single EPIC
              probe is not always informative for those distal regulatory
              elements showing variable methylation across the region. However,
              overall data from the EPIC array at single loci are highly
              reproducible across technical and biological replicates and
              demonstrate high correlation with HM450 and WGBS data. We show
              that the HM450 and EPIC arrays distinguish differentially
              methylated probes, but the absolute agreement depends on the
              threshold set for each platform. Finally, we provide an annotated
              list of probes whose signal could be affected by
              cross-hybridisation or underlying genetic variation. CONCLUSION:
              The EPIC array is a significant improvement over the HM450 array,

              reproducibility and reliability, providing a valuable tool for

              affected regions are and whether these epigenetic marks are known

              correction (FDR <0.05), 1890 CpG sites associated with total PBB
              levels. These CpGs were not enriched in any particular biological

              depleted in regions near the transcription start site or in CpG

              CpGs, blood had the highest proportion of CpGs correlated to

              patterns specific to the genomic region of interest must be
              considered. To assist in that objective, we have developed a

              and the process of aging. In this study we examine DNA
              methylation at 476,366 sites throughout the genome of white blood
              cells from a population cohort (N = 421) ranging in age from 14
              to 94 years old. Age affects DNA methylation at almost one third
              (29\%) of the sites (Bonferroni adjusted P-value <0.05), of which
              60.5\% becomes hypomethylated and 39.5\% hypermethylated with
              increasing age. DNA methylation sites that are located within CpG
              islands (CGIs) more often become hypermethylated compared to
              sites outside an island. CpG sites in promoters are more
              unaffected by age, whereas sites in enhancers more often becomes
              hypo- or hypermethylated. Hypermethylated sites are
              overrepresented among genes that are involved in DNA binding,
              transcription regulation, processes of anatomical structure and
              developmental process and cortex neuron differentiation (P-value

              not strongly overrepresented among any biological function or

              DNA methylation is attributed chronological age, and that
              hypermethylation is more site-specific than hypomethylation. It
              appears that the change in DNA methylation partly overlap with

              associated with adiposity/CVD risk measured (ages 17, 20, and 22
              years) and projected CVD by middle age. DESIGN: DNA methylation
              measured in peripheral blood provided two estimates of epigenetic
              age acceleration: intrinsic (IEAA; preserved across cell types)
              and extrinsic (EEAA; dependent on cell admixture and methylation
              levels within each cell type). Adiposity was assessed by
              anthropometry, ultrasound, and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry
              (ages 17, 20, and 22 years). CVD risk factors [lipids,
              homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR),
              blood pressure, inflammatory markers] were assessed at age 17
              years. CVD development by age 47 years was calculated by
              Framingham algorithms. Results are presented as regression
              coefficients per 5-year epigenetic age acceleration (IEAA/EEAA)
              for adiposity, CVD risk factors, and CVD development. RESULTS: In
              995 participants (49.6\% female; age, 17.3 $\pm$ 0.6 years), EEAA
              (per 5 years) was associated with increased body mass index (BMI)
              of 2.4\% (95\% CI, 1.2\% to 3.6\%) and 2.4\% (0.8\% to 3.9\%) at
              17 and 22 years, respectively. EEAA was associated with increases
              of 23\% (3\% to 33\%) in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein,
              10\% (4\% to 17\%) in interferon-$\gamma$-inducible protein of 10
              kDa, and 4\% (2\% to 6\%) in soluble TNF receptor 2, adjusted for
              BMI and HOMA-IR. EEAA (per 5 years) results in a 4\% increase in
              hard endpoints of CVD by 47 years of age and a 3\% increase,
              after adjustment for conventional risk factors. CONCLUSIONS:

               inflammation and disease risk, but the underlying molecular
               mechanisms are unclear. Because both aging and stress are also
               associated with lasting epigenetic changes, a plausible
               hypothesis is that stress along the lifespan could confer
               disease risk through epigenetic effects on molecules involved in
               inflammatory processes. Here, by combining large-scale analyses
               in human cohorts with experiments in cells, we report that
               FKBP5, a protein implicated in stress physiology, contributes to
               these relations. Across independent human cohorts (total n >
               3,000), aging synergized with stress-related phenotypes,
               measured with childhood trauma and major depression
               questionnaires, to epigenetically up-regulate FKBP5 expression.
               These age/stress-related epigenetic effects were recapitulated
               in a cellular model of replicative senescence, whereby we
               exposed replicating human fibroblasts to stress (glucocorticoid)
               hormones. Unbiased genome-wide analyses in human blood linked
               higher FKBP5 mRNA with a proinflammatory profile and altered
               NF-$\kappa$B--related gene networks. Accordingly, experiments in
               immune cells showed that higher FKBP5 promotes inflammation by
               strengthening the interactions of NF-$\kappa$B regulatory
               kinases, whereas opposing FKBP5 either by genetic deletion
               (CRISPR/Cas9-mediated) or selective pharmacological inhibition
               prevented the effects on NF-$\kappa$B. Further, the
               age/stress-related epigenetic signature enhanced FKBP5 response
               to NF-$\kappa$B through a positive feedback loop and was present
               in individuals with a history of acute myocardial infarction, a
               disease state linked to peripheral inflammation. These findings
               suggest that aging/stress-driven FKBP5--NF-$\kappa$B signaling
               mediates inflammation, potentially contributing to
               cardiovascular risk, and may thus point to novel biomarker and

  abstract = "Species that hibernate live longer than would be expected based
              solely on their body size. Hibernation is characterized by long
              periods of metabolic suppression (torpor) interspersed by short
              periods of increased metabolism (arousal). The torpor-arousal
              cycles occur multiple times during hibernation, and it has been
              suggested that processes controlling the transition between
              torpor and arousal states cause aging suppression. Metabolic rate
              is also a known correlate of longevity, we thus proposed the
              `hibernation-aging hypothesis' whereby aging is suspended during
              hibernation. We tested this hypothesis in a well-studied
              population of yellow-bellied marmots ( Marmota flaviventer ),
              which spend 7-8 months per year hibernating. We used two
              approaches to estimate epigenetic age: the epigenetic clock and
              the epigenetic pacemaker. Variation in epigenetic age of 149
              samples collected throughout the life of 73 females were modeled
              using generalized additive mixed models (GAMM), where season
              (cyclic cubic spline) and chronological age (cubic spline) were
              fixed effects. As expected, the GAMM using epigenetic ages
              calculated from the epigenetic pacemaker was better able to
              detect nonlinear patterns in epigenetic age change over time. We
              observed a logarithmic curve of epigenetic age with time, where
              the epigenetic age increased at a higher rate until females
              reached sexual maturity (2-years old). With respect to circannual
              patterns, the epigenetic age increased during the summer and
              essentially stalled during the winter. Our enrichment analysis of
              age-related CpG sites revealed pathways related to development
              and cell differentiation, while the season-related CpGs enriched
              pathways related to central carbon metabolism, immune system, and
              circadian clock. Taken together, our results are consistent with
              the hibernation-aging hypothesis and may explain the enhanced
              longevity in hibernators. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement SH

              by which reproductive factors impact on disease risk. However,
              few studies have investigated the link between reproductive
              factors and DNA methylation in humans. Genome-wide methylation in
              peripheral blood lymphocytes of 376 healthy women from the
              prospective EPIC study was investigated using LUminometric
              Methylation Assay (LUMA). Also, methylation of 458877 CpG sites
              was additionally investigated in an independent group of 332
              participants of the EPIC-Italy sub-cohort, using the Infinium
              HumanMethylation 450 BeadChip. Multivariate logistic regression
              and linear models were used to investigate the association
              between reproductive risk factors and genome wide and
              CpG-specific DNA methylation, respectively. Menarcheal age was
              inversely associated with global DNA methylation as measured with
              LUMA. For each yearly increase in age at menarche, the risk of
              having genome wide methylation below median level was increased
              by 32\% (OR:1.32, 95\%CI:1.14-1.53). When age at menarche was
              treated as a categorical variable, there was an inverse
              dose-response relationship with LUMA methylation levels (OR(12-14
              vs. $\leq$11 yrs):1.78, 95\%CI:1.01-3.17 and OR($\geq$15 vs.
              $\leq$11 yrs):4.59, 95\%CI:2.04-10.33; P for trend<0.0001).
              However, average levels of global methylation as measured by the
              Illumina technology were not significantly associated with
              menarcheal age. In locus by locus comparative analyses, only one
              CpG site had significantly different methylation depending on the
              menarcheal age category examined, but this finding was not
              replicated by pyrosequencing in an independent data set. This
              study suggests a link between age at menarche and genome wide DNA
              methylation, and the difference in results between the two arrays
              suggests that repetitive element methylation has a role in the
              association. Epigenetic changes may be modulated by menarcheal
              age, or the association may be a mirror of other important
              changes in early life that have a detectable effect on both
              methylation levels and menarcheal age.",

              about 25 Michigan farms were exposed to as much as 250 g per head
              of PBB when it was accidentally mixed in cattle feed in 1973 to
              1974. Livestock exposures several orders of magnitude lower
              occurred on several hundred other farms because of carryover and
              equipment contamination in feed mills. Approximately 85\% of the
              Michigan population received some exposure to PBB because dairy
              product marketing involves mixing milk from many farms. A few
              cases of high human exposure, which may have been as great as 10
              g, occurred when residents of the more highly exposed farms

  abstract = "In multiple studies DNA methylation has proven to be an accurate
              biomarker of age. To develop these biomarkers, the methylation of
              multiple CpG sites is typically linearly combined to predict
              chronological age. By contrast, in this study we apply the
              Universal PaceMaker (UPM) model to investigate changes in DNA
              methylation during aging. The UPM was initially developed to
              study rate acceleration/deceleration in sequence evolution.
              Rather than identifying which linear combinations of sites
              predicts age, the UPM models the rates of change of multiple CpG
              sites, as well as their starting methylation levels, and
              estimates the age of each individual to optimize the model fit.
              We refer to the estimated age as the ``epigenetic age'', which is
              in contrast to the known chronological age of each individual. We
              construct a statistical framework and devise an algorithm to
              determine whether a genomic pacemaker is in effect (i.e rates of
              change vary with age). The decision is made by comparing two
              competing likelihood based models, the molecular clock (MC) and
              UPM. For the molecular clock model, we use the known
              chronological age of each individual and fit the methylation
              rates at multiple sites, and express the problem as a linear
              least squares and solve it in polynomial time. For the UPM case,
              the search space is larger as we are fitting both the epigenetic
              age of each individual as well as the rates for each site, yet we
              succeed to reduce the problem to the space of individuals and
              polynomial in the more significant space-the methylated sites. We
              first tested our algorithm on simulated data to elucidate the
              factors affecting the identification of the pacemaker model. We
              find that, provided with enough data, our algorithm is capable of
              identifying a pacemaker even when a weak signal is present in the
              data. Based on these results, we applied our method to DNA
              methylation data from human blood from individuals of various
              ages. Although the improvement in variance across sites between
              the UPM and MC was small, the results suggest that the existence
              of a pacemaker is highly significant. The PaceMaker results also
              suggest a decay in the rate of change in DNA methylation with
              age.",
